# WORKWAY: The Honest Positioning

## Acknowledging the Competition

You're right. Let's be completely honest about where WORKWAY fits in the market.

### Zapier Pricing Reality
- **Free**: 100 tasks/month (actually quite generous!)
- **Professional**: $29.99/month with multi-step, AI via OpenAI connection
- **Team**: $103.50/month with collaboration
- **AI Access**: Connect your own OpenAI account OR use their credits

### Make.com Pricing Reality
- **Free**: 1,000 operations/month
- **Core**: $9/month for 10,000 operations
- **Pro**: $16/month with more operations
- **AI Access**: Built-in AI actions with operations counting

## Where WORKWAY ACTUALLY Wins

### 1. **You're Building a Business, Not Just Automating**

**The Fundamental Difference:**

| Platform | What You Can Do | What You Can't Do |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Zapier/Make** | Build automations for yourself | Sell those automations to others |
| **WORKWAY** | Build AND sell workflows | Keep 70% of revenue |

```javascript
// Zapier: You build, you use
const zapierModel = {
  build: 'your automation',
  use: 'yourself or your company',
  sell: 'NOT ALLOWED',
  earn: '$0'
};

// WORKWAY: You build, others pay you
const workwayModel = {
  build: 'your automation',
  use: 'anyone',
  sell: 'ENCOURAGED',
  earn: '70% of whatever you charge'
};
```

### 2. **Performance at the Edge (This Actually Matters)**

**Real-world scenario: E-commerce checkout flow**

```javascript
// Customer in Tokyo adds item to cart
const latencyComparison = {
  zapier: {
    location: 'US-East datacenter',
    latency: '250ms',
    customerExperience: 'Noticeable delay'
  },

  workway: {
    location: 'Tokyo edge location',
    latency: '10ms',
    customerExperience: 'Instant'
  }
};
```

For workflows that touch customer experience, edge deployment isn't a nice-to-have—it's essential.

### 3. **Model Diversity for Specific Tasks**

**Yes, Zapier has OpenAI. But:**

```javascript
const aiTaskOptimization = {
  // Zapier: One-size-fits-all
  zapier: {
    everyTask: 'GPT-3.5 or GPT-4',
    cost: 'Same regardless of complexity',
    speed: 'Same regardless of need'
  },

  // WORKWAY: Right tool for the job
  workway: {
    simpleClassification: 'Llama 2 (100x cheaper)',
    codeGeneration: 'DeepSeek Coder (optimized)',
    translation: 'M2M100 (100+ languages)',
    imageGen: 'Stable Diffusion (included)',
    embeddings: 'BGE models (for search)'
  }
};
```

### 4. **True Ownership and Control**

```javascript
const dataControl = {
  zapier: {
    yourData: 'Flows through their servers',
    compliance: 'Their certifications',
    downtime: 'You wait',
    pricing: 'They decide'
  },

  workway: {
    yourData: 'Stays in your Cloudflare account',
    compliance: 'Your controls',
    downtime: 'Your SLA',
    pricing: 'You set for your customers'
  }
};
```

## The REAL Target Market

### WORKWAY is NOT for:
- ❌ Non-technical users who need pure no-code
- ❌ Someone automating 5 tasks a month
- ❌ Companies that just need internal automation
- ❌ Users happy with Zapier's free tier

### WORKWAY IS for:
- ✅ **Developers who want to sell automation as a service**
- ✅ **Agencies building workflows for multiple clients**
- ✅ **SaaS companies needing embedded automation**
- ✅ **Enterprises requiring data sovereignty**
- ✅ **High-volume processors (>10K operations/month)**

## Honest Pricing Comparison

### Low Volume (100 workflows/month)
```
Zapier Free: $0 (winner for this use case!)
Make Free: $0 (also great!)
WORKWAY: $29 (overkill for this volume)
```

### Medium Volume (5,000 workflows/month)
```
Zapier Professional: $29.99 + overages ≈ $50
Make Pro: $34
WORKWAY: $29 + usage ≈ $35

About the same! The difference is what you can DO with it.
```

### High Volume (50,000 workflows/month)
```
Zapier Team: $103.50 + significant overages ≈ $300
Make Teams: $220
WORKWAY: $99 + usage ≈ $150

WORKWAY starts winning on pure cost.
```

### Business Model (Selling to 100 customers)
```
Zapier: Can't do it (ToS violation)
Make: Can't do it (ToS violation)
WORKWAY: $49 × 100 = $4,900/month revenue
         Your take: $3,430/month (70%)
```

## The Honest Pitch

### Stop Saying This:
> "WORKWAY is 100x cheaper than Zapier!"

(It's not always true and makes us look dishonest)

### Start Saying This:
> "WORKWAY lets developers build and sell automation workflows. It's the only platform where your workflows can become your business."

### The Three Pillars

1. **Build a Business**: Create workflows others pay for
2. **Edge Performance**: 10ms latency globally
3. **True Ownership**: Your infrastructure, your rules

## Migration Path Reality

```javascript
const migrationHonesty = {
  easyMigration: {
    from: 'Starting fresh',
    effort: 'Easy',
    timeframe: '1 day'
  },

  mediumMigration: {
    from: 'Simple Zapier/Make workflows',
    effort: 'Moderate',
    timeframe: '1 week',
    challenge: 'Rewriting visual flows as code'
  },

  hardMigration: {
    from: 'Complex enterprise Zapier setup',
    effort: 'Significant',
    timeframe: '1-2 months',
    challenge: 'Dependency on specific integrations'
  }
};
```

## When to Recommend Zapier/Make

Be honest with potential users:

### Use Zapier when:
- You need 100% visual/no-code
- You're doing <1000 tasks/month
- You need their specific app integrations
- You want their support

### Use Make when:
- You prefer visual programming
- You need complex branching logic (visual)
- You're in the EU (data residency)
- You want cheaper mid-tier pricing

### Use WORKWAY when:
- You can write JavaScript/TypeScript
- You want to sell your automations
- Performance really matters
- You need data sovereignty
- You're processing >10K tasks/month
- You want to own your infrastructure

## The Compelling Truth

**WORKWAY's real value proposition:**

> "We're not trying to be a cheaper Zapier. We're building the platform where the next Zapier will be built."

Someone using WORKWAY could literally build a Zapier competitor on top of our infrastructure and charge their own customers. That's the power we're offering.

## Success Metrics That Matter

Instead of comparing task counts, compare:

| Metric | Zapier User | WORKWAY Developer |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Monthly Cost** | $30-100 | $30-100 |
| **Monthly Revenue** | $0 | $500-5,000 |
| **Latency** | 200-500ms | 10-50ms |
| **Scaling** | Buy higher tier | Automatic |
| **Business Built** | No | Yes |

## The Developer-First Advantage

```typescript
// This is what sets us apart
interface WorkwayDeveloper {
  // You're not a user, you're a creator
  builds: 'Products',
  sells: 'To end users',
  earns: 'Recurring revenue',
  owns: 'The relationship',

  // Your customers don't know about WORKWAY
  whitelabel: true,
  customDomain: true,
  customPricing: true,

  // You're building a business
  outcome: 'SaaS founder, not automation user'
}
```

## Final Positioning Statement

### WORKWAY: The Platform for Automation Entrepreneurs

**We're not competing with Zapier on price.**
**We're enabling developers to compete with Zapier on product.**

Every successful WORKWAY developer isn't switching from Zapier—they're building what Zapier users will switch to.

## The Three Questions That Matter

1. **Do you want to build automations or sell them?**
   - Build only → Use Zapier/Make
   - Sell → Use WORKWAY

2. **Does performance matter for your use case?**
   - Internal only → Zapier/Make is fine
   - Customer-facing → WORKWAY's edge wins

3. **Do you want to own your infrastructure?**
   - Managed service → Zapier/Make
   - Your control → WORKWAY

## Construction Vertical: Procore Helix as Market Catalyst

### The Competitive Reality (February 2026)

Procore launched **Procore Helix** -- a full AI intelligence layer for construction with:
- **Procore Assist**: Conversational AI embedded in the platform
- **AI Agents**: Draft RFIs, manage submittals, generate reports
- **Agent Builder**: No-code custom agent creation
- **Developer Studio** (coming soon): Third-party AI development on Procore

This is **good news** for WORKWAY's construction vertical. Procore spent the money to educate the market. The conversation shifts from "why AI?" to "which AI architecture?"

### The Three-Tier Analysis

The Three-Tier Framework (Database, Automation, Judgment) reveals the structural difference:

**Procore Helix collapses all three control models into Procore-controlled:**
- Database: Procore decides what AI can see (only Procore data)
- Automation: Procore decides what agents can do (their templates)
- Judgment: Procore defines the constraints (their defaults)

**WORKWAY preserves the separation:**
- Database: Application-controlled -- your MCP servers expose data from any system
- Automation: Model-controlled -- your AI model (Claude, GPT, Gemini) reasons about what to do
- Judgment: User-controlled -- your team defines policy artifacts that govern behavior

### Why This Matters for Construction

Construction is uniquely sensitive to the control model question:

1. **Liability flows through documentation.** Who controls what AI sees determines what gets documented. Procore can't pull in meeting context, subcontractor emails, or external schedules.

2. **Approval hierarchies are firm-specific.** Procore's Agent Builder offers generic templates. WORKWAY's Skills encode YOUR firm's specific approval chain.

3. **Compliance varies by project.** A federal project needs different AI constraints than a commercial build. WORKWAY treats policy as a versioned artifact -- selectable per project, per jurisdiction, per client.

### The Judgment Layer Pathway

Procore Helix creates demand for governance that Procore can't offer:

| Product | Framework Tier | Revenue Model |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| MCP Wedge | Database (connectivity) | Free |
| Skills Marketplace | Automation (outcomes) | Per-run |
| Policy Marketplace | Judgment (governance) | Per-project |
| Enterprise | Full stack | Per-seat + governance |

**Policy as marketplace artifact**: Domain experts sell compliance templates, trust profiles, and approval workflows. Construction professionals encoding jurisdictional expertise -- a seller persona Procore can't enable because it would undermine their platform control.

### Use Procore Helix when:
- All your AI needs are Procore-only
- You want zero-setup AI inside the tool you already use
- You don't need custom compliance rules per project
- Agent Builder's no-code approach fits your team

### Use WORKWAY when:
- Your projects span 8-12 tools (Procore + Slack + Sage + P6 + DocuSign + ...)
- You need cross-system AI that pulls context from meetings, schedules, AND Procore
- You need per-project compliance rules under your control
- You want to choose your AI model and audit every decision
- You're building a construction AI practice, not just consuming features

### The "And" Positioning

The smartest pitch: **Procore Helix + WORKWAY > Procore Helix alone.**

WORKWAY doesn't replace Helix. It extends it across systems and puts your team in control of the governance layer. Buyers don't have to choose.

## Conclusion

Let's be honest:
- Zapier and Make are great products for general automation
- Procore Helix is a strong first-party AI offering for Procore-only workflows
- They each serve their markets well

But they're tools for users within walled gardens.
WORKWAY is infrastructure for builders who need cross-system reach and control.

**We're not disrupting Zapier. We're enabling the developers who will.**
**We're not competing with Procore Helix. We're extending it across everything else.**
