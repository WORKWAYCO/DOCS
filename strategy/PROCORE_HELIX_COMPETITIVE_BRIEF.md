# Procore Helix Competitive Brief

> Quick reference for team conversations, sales calls, and investor discussions.

*Last updated: February 2026*

## TL;DR

Procore Helix validates the market. It does NOT threaten WORKWAY. It creates the reference point that makes our differentiation easier to sell and unlocks the Judgment Layer pathway.

**One sentence**: "Procore proved AI works for construction. WORKWAY extends it across every system, under your governance."

## What Procore Helix Is

| Component | What It Does | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Procore Assist** | Conversational AI -- search docs, answer questions, generate reports | Live |
| **AI Agents** | Automate tasks -- draft RFIs, manage submittals, generate reports | Live |
| **Agent Builder** | No-code custom agent creation for firm-specific workflows | Live |
| **Analytics 2.0** | Predictive analytics, portfolio intelligence, benchmarking | Live |
| **Developer Studio** | Third-party AI development on Procore's platform | Coming soon |

**Distribution**: 2M+ daily users, 17,000+ customers. Embedded in the tool they already use.

## Why This Is Good News

1. **Market education** -- Buyers now understand "AI for construction." We don't sell the category.
2. **Reference point** -- "You've seen Helix. Here's what it can't do." Faster conversation.
3. **Validation** -- Procore investing in AI proves the market to investors and partners.
4. **Demand creation** -- Buyers who taste single-system AI feel the cross-system gaps faster.

## The Control Model Argument

Procore Helix collapses all three control models into Procore-controlled. WORKWAY preserves the separation.

| Question | Procore Helix | WORKWAY |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| What can AI see? | Only Procore data | Any system via MCP (21+ integrations) |
| What can AI do? | Procore's agent templates | Your AI model reasons (Claude, GPT, Gemini, local) |
| What rules govern AI? | Procore's defaults | Your versioned policy artifacts |
| Can you audit the code? | No (black box) | Yes (open source) |
| Cross-system? | No | Yes |
| Per-project compliance? | Limited | Full (policy as artifact) |

**Why this matters for construction**: Liability flows through documentation. Approval hierarchies are firm-specific. Compliance varies by project and jurisdiction. All three require control model separation.

## Procore Helix Can't Do These Things

Structural limitations, not feature gaps (they can't fix these without abandoning platform economics):

1. **Pull context from Zoom meetings** where issues were first discussed
2. **Cross-reference P6 schedules** to flag downstream impact of RFIs
3. **Route drafts through DocuSign** for subcontractor review
4. **Post summaries to Slack** project channels
5. **Update Sage budgets** when RFIs imply change orders
6. **Apply firm-specific compliance rules** that differ by project type
7. **Version governance policy** for different jurisdictions
8. **Provide audit trails** for AI decisions across systems
9. **Let customers choose AI models** (Claude vs. GPT vs. local)
10. **Open source the integration code** for customer audit

## Conversation Playbook

### For Project Managers

> "You've used Procore Assist to draft an RFI. Now imagine that RFI pulling context from the Zoom meeting where the issue was first discussed, cross-referenced with the P6 schedule, under your firm's compliance rules -- not Procore's defaults."

### For IT / DevOps

> "Procore Helix is great for Procore-only workflows. But your projects span 8-12 tools. WORKWAY connects all of them, you choose the AI model, and you can audit every line of code."

### For Executives

> "Procore proved AI works for construction. WORKWAY extends that across your entire tool stack -- and your team controls the policy, not Procore."

### Handling Objections

**"We already have Procore Helix."**
> "Great -- Helix is excellent for Procore-only workflows. WORKWAY extends it. Think of everything that happens outside Procore: meetings, emails, schedules in P6, budgets in Sage. WORKWAY brings all of that into your AI. Helix + WORKWAY > Helix alone."

**"Procore Agent Builder lets us customize."**
> "Agent Builder lets you customize what agents do. WORKWAY lets you customize what rules govern them -- per project, per jurisdiction, per client. That's the governance layer."

**"Developer Studio is coming."**
> "When it ships, it'll enable cross-system on Procore's platform. But governance -- who controls the compliance rules, audit trails, and approval gates -- that's structurally outside Procore's model. They need uniform control to scale. You need per-project control to comply."

## The Judgment Layer Opportunity

Procore Helix creates demand for governance that Procore can't supply:

| Product Layer | Framework Tier | Pricing | What It Does |
|--------------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| MCP Wedge | Database | Free | Connect construction tools to AI |
| Skills Marketplace | Automation | Per-run | Cross-system outcomes (RFI drafting, log digests) |
| Policy Marketplace | Judgment | Per-project | Governance artifacts (compliance rules, trust profiles, audit) |
| Enterprise | Full stack | Per-seat + governance | Bundled governance infrastructure |

**Policy as marketplace artifact**: Construction professionals (not just developers) sell compliance templates, approval workflows, and trust profiles. A new seller persona that Procore can't enable.

## Honest Assessment

### Where Procore Helix is stronger:
- Distribution (embedded in the tool 2M+ people already use)
- No-code accessibility (Agent Builder vs. our TypeScript approach)
- Zero-setup experience (no MCP installation needed)
- First-party data advantage (no integration layer needed for Procore data)

### Where WORKWAY is stronger:
- Cross-system orchestration (21+ integrations vs. Procore only)
- Control model separation (user-controlled vs. vendor-controlled)
- AI model choice (any model vs. Procore's models)
- Open-source auditability (readable code vs. black box)
- Judgment Layer / governance (policy as artifact vs. fixed defaults)

### The window:
- 12-18 months before Developer Studio ships and potentially enables cross-system on Procore
- The Judgment Layer (governance, policy, audit) is structurally outside Procore's reach regardless of Developer Studio
- Establish cross-system + governance position now
